However, this version of ESET NOD32 Antivirus is not an official release from ESET, and it may not be compatible with the latest updates and features of ESET products.

In this article, we will explore some of the features and benefits of ESET NOD32 Antivirus, and how it can help you keep your computer secure and optimized.
 
## Cloud-powered scanning
 
Cloud-powered scanning is a feature that allows ESET NOD32 Antivirus to use the power of the ESET LiveGrid cloud database to detect and block new and emerging threats. This feature enables faster and more accurate scanning, as well as reducing the system resources used by the antivirus. Cloud-powered scanning also allows ESET NOD32 Antivirus to scan files that are not commonly scanned, such as network drives, removable media, or files in archives. You can enable or disable cloud-powered scanning from the Advanced setup menu of your ESET product.
 
## Device control
 
Device control is a feature that allows you to monitor and control the devices that are connected to your computer, such as USB drives, CD/DVD drives, printers, scanners, cameras, and more. You can create rules to allow or block specific devices based on their type, vendor, model, serial number, or other criteria. You can also set actions to be performed when a device is connected or disconnected, such as scanning for malware, displaying a notification, logging an event, or sending an email. Device control helps you prevent unauthorized access to your data and protect your computer from malware infections from external devices. You can access device control from the Tools menu of your ESET product.
 
## Gamer mode
 
Gamer mode is a feature that allows you to enjoy uninterrupted gaming or full-screen entertainment without compromising your security. When gamer mode is enabled, ESET NOD32 Antivirus automatically switches to silent mode, which means it suppresses pop-up notifications, system updates, and scheduled tasks. It also optimizes the system performance by reducing the priority of background processes and limiting the network bandwidth used by the antivirus. Gamer mode helps you avoid distractions and interruptions while maintaining a high level of protection. You can enable or disable gamer mode from the main program window of your ESET product.
