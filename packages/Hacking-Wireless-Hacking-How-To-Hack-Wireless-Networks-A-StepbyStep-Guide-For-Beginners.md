# Hacking Wireless Hacking: How To Hack Wireless Networks - A Step-by-Step Guide For Beginners
  
Wireless networks are everywhere. They provide us with internet access, communication, entertainment, and convenience. But they also pose a security risk. Hackers can exploit wireless networks to steal data, spy on users, disrupt services, or cause damage. In this article, we will show you how to hack wireless networks using some basic tools and techniques. This is a beginner's guide, so we will not cover advanced topics such as encryption, authentication, or countermeasures. However, you should be aware that hacking wireless networks is illegal and unethical in most cases, and you should only do it for educational purposes or with permission from the network owner.

## What You Need
  
To hack wireless networks, you will need the following:
  
- A computer with a wireless adapter that supports monitor mode and packet injection. Monitor mode allows you to capture all the traffic on a wireless channel, while packet injection allows you to send your own packets to manipulate the network. Some common wireless adapters that support these features are Alfa AWUS036NHA, TP-Link TL-WN722N, and Panda PAU09.
- A software tool that can scan, analyze, and attack wireless networks. There are many tools available for different operating systems, but we will use Kali Linux as an example. Kali Linux is a popular distribution of Linux that comes with a collection of hacking tools pre-installed. You can download Kali Linux from [here](https://www.kali.org/downloads/) and install it on your computer or run it from a USB drive.
- A target wireless network that you want to hack. Ideally, you should choose a network that you own or have permission to hack. Otherwise, you may face legal consequences if you get caught. You should also avoid hacking networks that are secured with WPA2 or WPA3 encryption, as they are very difficult to crack without knowing the password.

## How To Hack Wireless Networks
  
Once you have everything ready, you can follow these steps to hack wireless networks:

1. Put your wireless adapter in monitor mode. This will allow you to capture all the traffic on a wireless channel. To do this, open a terminal window in Kali Linux and type the following command:

  ``` airmon-ng start wlan0 ```  
This will create a new interface called wlan0mon that is in monitor mode. You can check the status of your interfaces by typing:
``` iwconfig ```
1. Scan for wireless networks in your area. This will help you find your target network and its details such as channel, encryption type, MAC address, signal strength, etc. To do this, type the following command:

  ``` airodump-ng wlan0mon ```  
This will display a list of wireless networks and their details. You can press Ctrl+C to stop the scan when you find your target network. Note down the channel (CH), encryption type (ENC), MAC address (BSSID), and ESSID (name) of your target network.

1. Focus on your target network and capture its handshake. A handshake is a four-way exchange of packets between a wireless client and an access point (AP) that establishes a connection and verifies the password. If you capture the handshake, you can use it later to crack the password offline. To do this, type the following command:

  ``` airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <mac address=""> -w <filename> wlan0mon
```

<p>Replace <channel> with the channel number of your target network, <mac address=""> with the MAC address of your target network, and <filename> with any name you want to save the captured packets as. This will start capturing packets from your target network and save them in a file with .cap extension.</filename></mac></channel></p>

<p>To capture the handshake, you need to wait for a client to connect or reconnect to the AP. This may take some time depending on the traffic on the network</p> 0f148eb4a0
